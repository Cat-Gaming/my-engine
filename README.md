# About
This is a project I am working on where I create a game engine.

# Platforms supported:
Only linux is supported so far. But I am adding windows support later.

# Dependencies:
X11 is the only dependency right now but that may change.

# Building:
You can change the compiler in the CC flag in the makefile to what ever you want. For example: 
```
CC=clang++
```
If you want to build with multithreading use the `-j` compiler flag.
